## Define Gross Return, Net Return and Log Return

Given a prices vector, calculate the above returns

```{r}
prices <- c(1.3, 1.2)

# Gross return
# Formula Rg(t) = S(t)/S(t-1)
gross <- prices[2] / prices[1]
gross

# Net return
# Formula r(t) = S(t)/S(t-1) - 1
net <- prices[2]/ prices[1] - 1
net

# Log return
# Formula:
# Rlog(t) = log(1 + r(1)) = log(S(t) / S(t-1)) = log(S(t)) - log(S(t-1))
# You may need to know the logarithm rules (product rule, power rule, quotient rule, etc), see: https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=logarithm+rules&oq=logarithm+rules&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4676j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
diff(log(prices))
```
