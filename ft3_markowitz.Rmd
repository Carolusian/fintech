## Portfolio of Two Risky Assets

* `Portfolio`: the idea is to place a set of securities into a basket with weights representing amount of investment in each
* `Variance`: representing the volatility or the risky. So we are interested in how to minimize the risk. Below is the formula, where a/b are investment weights and X/Y are two investment returns:

> `Var(aX + bY) = E(aX + bY)^2 - E^2 (aX + bY) = a^2 Var(X) + b^2 Var(Y) + 2abCov(X, Y)`
