## Rudimentary Knowledge

* Sharpe Ratio: `mean return` above risk-free rate divided by the volatility (measure of risk). It means, given per unit of risk, what is the expected return. Of course, you want to reduce the risk and maxmise you return. Sharpe Ratio of different time interval cannot be compared together

$$\frac{E\{R_p\} - \mu_f}{\sigma_p}$$

```{r}
sharpe_ratio <- function (mean_return, mu_free, sd) {
  mean_return - mu_free / sd
}

prune_by_sharpe <- function (prices, lab, mean_return, sd, thresh_sr, mu_free = 0) {
  # Plot all sharpe ratios of given candidate set of tickers before they are pruned
  par(mar=c(4, 4, 1, 1))
  par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
  independent_sr <- sharpe_ratio(mean_return, mu_free, thresh_sr) 
  len <- length(independent_sr)
  plot(independent_sr, ylab='SR', col=4)
  plot(sort(independent_sr), ylab='SR', col=4)
  
  # Draw a line according to given x, y
  lines(1:len, rep(thresh_sr, len))
  
  # Filter out candidates whose SR less than thresh_sr
  independent_high_sr <- (independent_sr > thresh_sr) # The result is a TRUE/FALSE vector
  
  # cleanup NAs
  for (d in 1:length(independent_high_sr))
    if (is.na(independent_high_sr[d]))
      independent_high_sr <- F
  
  len <- dim(prices)[1] # how many rows           1258 for huge stockdata
  wid <- dim(prices)[2] # how many stock tickers  452  for huge stockdata: 452 S&P 500 stock tickers
  smaller_size <- sum(independent_high_sr) # The size of candidate kept
  new_prices <- matrix(rep(0, len * smaller_size), nrow=len, ncol=smaller_size) # A matrix to construct new price matrix of the candidate stocks kept, row count is still len, be column count reduced
  new_label <- vector(length = smaller_size)

    if (independent_high_sr[d]) {
      print(paste('e', e))
      new_prices[, e] <- prices[, d]
      new_label[e] <- lab[d]
      e <- e + 1
